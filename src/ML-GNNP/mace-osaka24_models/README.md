# MACE-Osaka24 models
This repository provides the model and training scripts for a multi-domain universal machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), the MACE-Osaka24 models, capable of accurately describing both crystalline and molecular domains.

The MACE-Osaka24 model is a universal MLIP trained on datasets of both crystals and molecules, which were generated using a dataset integration technique called "Total Energy Alignment" that combines first-principles calculations under various conditions. 

Its architecture is based on the first-generation MACE model. To use the models please install the [MACE code](https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace).

## Models

The first generation of models are available in the [MACE-Osaka24](https://github.com/qiqb-osaka/mace-osaka24/releases/tag/v0.0.1).

If you use the models, in addition to citing the original MACE papers, please cite:

## Training scripts

We provide training scripts for the models in this repository. The latest training command line is found in [`mace-osaka24/mace-osaka24-large.sh`](mace_osaka24/mace-osaka24-large.sh).

## Training data

The integrated inorganic–organic domain dataset used to train the models—composed of the inorganic MPtrj dataset and the organic SPICE, QMug, water clusters, and Tripeptides (OFF23) datasets—is available at [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Inorganic_organic_domain_dataset/28023149). If you use any of these datasets, please cite the following paper.

## Example

In this example, the energy of a silicon crystal and acetic acid is calculated using universal multi-domain MLIP MACE-Osaka24 and Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE).

```python
from ase.build import bulk
from ase.build import molecule
from mace.calculators import MACECalculator

si = bulk('Si', 'diamond', a=5.43)
calculator = MACECalculator(model_path='/path-to-mace-osaka24/mace-osaka24-large.model', device='cpu')
si.calc = calculator 

energy_si = si.get_potential_energy()
print("Single-point energy of diamond Si:", energy_si)

acid = molecule('CH3COOH')
calculator = MACECalculator(model_path='/path-to-mace-osaka24/mace-osaka24-large.model', device='cpu')
acid.calc = calculator 

energy_acid = acid.get_potential_energy()
print("Single-point energy of acetic acid:", energy_acid)
```
